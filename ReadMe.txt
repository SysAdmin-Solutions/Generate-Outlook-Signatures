Before starting the program for the first time, you need to configure your options in the Generate Outlook Signatures.exe.config file, or go through the initial program setup (if the mode is set to "0")


The first option you need to configure is your "DomainAddress" which is in the form of (OU=ou,DC=contoso,DC=com). This is what will be used to pull the AD users.
You (the person generating the list) must have read access to ADUC (Active Directory Users and Computers), otherwise the list won't generate.

The second option you need to define is the "MasterListLocation" which is a network address, which will be the location of the Templates and Users' signatures.
This location MUST be writeable to you (the person generating the list) and readable to all end users. This could be the netlogon folder on your DC, or a hidden share like I prefer.

The third option you need to configure is the "Mode" which tells the program which mode it will run in. The current available modes are:
"0"		= Run initial program setup to define the variables.
"1"		= Generate Signatures for all AD users, using master list repository.
"2"		= Generate Signatures for currently signed in user, and import them into outlook.
"3"		= Recieve Signatures for current signed in user using the master list repository created in mode "1".

Once you set those variables in the config file, go ahead and run the program for the first time.
It will detect that you do not have a template folder and will create it for you, then close itself.

Next, go ahead and put your template files into the templates folder, which will be located in your master file location. These files should be saved as a .Docx or .rtf file.

Inside your Templates, you must include all of the AD variable text that will be replaced with user info. These must match exactly, and are case sensitive.
You do not need to use every variable provided, and if you provide a variable in your template that a user does not have, it will substitute it for blank space.
Here is the list of variables you need to include, as well as the corresponding AD attribute they will be substituted with. You must include the [ brackets ] with the variables.

User's Display Name							=		[[ADDisplayName]]
User's Title								=		[[ADTitle]]
User's Department							=		[[ADDepartment]]
User's Email								=		[[Email]]
User's Office Phone							=		[[ADTelePhoneNumber]]
User's Direct Phone							=		[[ADDID]]
User's Cell Phone							=		[[ADMobile]]
User's Fax Number							=		[[ADFax]]


Once you finish crafting all of your templates, make sure you don't have any of the templates open in any other applications.

Then run the program,
If you are in mode 1, it will construct all of the signatures for every user in AD that has an email address listed.
Be sure to check several users to make sure all of the signatures are being generated correctly. Any typos in the AD variables will cause it to not work properly.
Anytime your User's information changes, or you update any of the templates, just run this program again, and it will regenerate fresh signatures with the new info.
The user will just have to rerun the Retrieve program to grab the new signatures, once they are regenerated.


Once done, provide a copy of this program configured to your Master List Location, and set to mode "3".
The program will then grab the signatures generated by this mode, and put them into the user's outlook signatures.
Be sure that the Retrieve program's masterlist is configured the exact same as this program is.

If you are in mode 2, the program will automatically generate signatures from the templates for the currently signed in user, then import it into their outlook signatures.
Please keep in mind, you still need to put the template files in the masterlist location on the server in a place where all users can read.
No further action is required. You can then rerun the program to regenerate the signatures if there are any changes or errors.


#Change Log
1.0.1.0 -	Fixed the bug which caused plain text emails to show random characters in outlook signatures.

1.2.0.0 -	Combined the recieve program into this program, making it the only program needed to use all functions.
			Added additional mode "standalone" and mode variable to select the mode.
			Added mode 0 which initializes the program by allowing you to set your variables via prompt.
